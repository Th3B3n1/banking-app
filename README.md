# banking-app

A fully functional frontend and backend that tries to replicate how a bare-bones banking app theoretically works. This was a school project that required the use of the followings:
      - React for the frontend (or something similar like Angular)
      - Node.js for the backend (NestJS could have been used, but I don't have a lot of experience with it)
